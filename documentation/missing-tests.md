Based on the codebase search, hereâ€™s a summary of **test coverage** and **potential gaps**:

### Areas with Test Coverage

- **API Layer:**  
  - `internal/api/handler_test.go` covers REST API handlers for executions (list, get by ID).
- **Repository Layer:**  
  - `internal/repository/execution_repository_test.go` covers the execution repository (CRUD with Postgres, using testcontainers).
- **Service Layer:**  
  - `internal/service/execution_service_test.go` covers business logic, fill quantity, status transitions, price checks, and error handling.
- **Kafka Integration:**  
  - `internal/kafka/kafka_integration_test.go` covers producing and consuming messages with a real Kafka broker.
  
### Areas **Not** Covered by Tests (Potential Gaps)

1. **Configuration Layer (`internal/config/`)**
   - Files like `config.go`, `db.go`, `log.go`, `otel.go` (configuration loading, DB connection, logger, tracing) have **no direct tests**.
   - These are typically tested indirectly (e.g., via integration tests), but there are no explicit unit or integration tests for config loading, logger, or tracer initialization.

2. **Kafka Utility Functions**
   - `internal/kafka/kafka.go` (functions like `CreateFillsTopicIfNotExists`, `NewOrdersConsumer`, `NewFillsProducer`) are **not directly tested**.
   - Only the low-level Kafka integration is tested, not your utility wrappers or topic creation logic.

3. **External Service Clients**
   - `internal/service/pricing_client.go` and any similar files for other external services (e.g., security service) have **no direct tests** for their HTTP client logic, error handling, or response parsing.

4. **Middleware**
   - No test files found for `internal/middleware/` (e.g., logging, tracing, CORS middleware).
   - Middleware logic is not directly tested.

5. **Observability/Instrumentation**
   - No direct tests for Prometheus metrics, OpenTelemetry tracing, or logging setup.

6. **Main Application Entrypoint**
   - No tests for startup/shutdown logic, wiring, or graceful shutdown in `cmd/`.

**If you want to improve coverage,** consider adding tests for:
- Configuration loading and error cases
- Kafka utility functions (topic creation, consumer/producer setup)
- External service clients (mock HTTP server, error handling)
- Middleware (unit tests for each middleware)
- Observability setup (at least smoke tests)
- Main application startup/shutdown (integration/smoke tests)

Let me know if you want help generating tests for any of these areas!
